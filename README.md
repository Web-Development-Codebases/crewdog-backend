# js-watermark-backend

Node.js API to add watermark to the video's being uploaded on the go 

add_watermark endpoint is for H2people 
add_watermark_crewdog endpoint is for Crewdog 

TODO (experiment) : Lower the quality in-order to lower the uploading time or some other way. (Fine currently, not required as compulsory)

Check if webm works or not.it's working in postman though but not on webapp 

## This requires certificate refresh every 3 months to work 

TODO: Try server side videos maybe
